PhD positions for 2026 have been filled. Students with a master degree and security/software engineering background are required (e.g., program analysis, reverse engineering.) unless you have a proved record in security and software engineering venues. 3.3/4.0 in GPA is required at MSU. If you are a prospective PhD student, I highly suggest reaching out to me early so that we can both check if there is a fit between us.
